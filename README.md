## JavaScript and DOM Self Assessment

This project demonstrates loading and displaying Airbnb listing data using vanilla JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and asynchronous data fetching (`fetch` + `async/await`).

The page dynamically loads and renders the first 50 listings from a local JSON file and displays key information for each listing.
